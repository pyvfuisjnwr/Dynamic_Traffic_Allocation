A dynamic traffic assignment framework for policy analysis in cities with significant share of two-wheelers


• Proposed a DTA framework that accounts for two-wheeler specific features in disordered traffic.
• Bridges the gap in existing studies that has not considered certain class specific phenomenon in multi-class DTA.
• Recognition of influence of class specific behavior in travel time and routing dynamics.
• Obtained optimum number of exclusive two-wheeler lanes and its location based on routing behavior in
network.
• A potential strategic planning and policy making tool for urban areas with a significant share of two-wheelers.
• Implementations are done using Python and Optimizations are done based on MSA algorithm.
